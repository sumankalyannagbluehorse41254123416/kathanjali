                                the soil is red and the air smells of freedom, a boy was born in 1889, Khudiram Bose. He was
                                just another village child, barefoot and bright-eyed, until destiny called him to a place in
                                history.

                                Aparupa raised him with care, sending him first to Hamilton High School in Tamluk, and later to
                                Midnapore Collegiate School. It was here that Khudiram’s spirit met the fire of revolution. The
                                Swadeshi movement had reached Midnapore, and the boy listened wide-eyed to leaders like
                                Aurobindo Ghosh and Sister Nivedita, who came to inspire students.

                                terms for simply shouting slogans, and ordered public floggings to break the spirit of Swadeshi
                                workers. His name was whispered with anger in tea shops, schools, and households

                                cloth. Their hearts pounded, not with fear, but with fire.

                                unflinching hand of a 17-year-old patriot. The explosion tore through the night. But fate played
                                its cruel trick — the carriage carried not Kingsford, but two Englishwomen. They died, while
                                Kingsford escaped.

                                On the night of 10 August 1908, Muzaffarpur jail fell silent. While the world slept, Khudiram
                                lay peacefully on his cot, as though it were just another evening. The jailers whispered, amazed
                                at his composure. At dawn, he bathed, prayed quietly, and asked for water.


                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                                Then came the moment. With steady steps, Khudiram walked to the hanging platform. His head was
                                held high, his face radiant, and on his lips — a smile. The rope was tightened, the crowd
                                outside sobbed, yet Khudiram remained calm.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">At just 18 years old, he embraced death as if it were destiny.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">The Song of Immortality</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Bengal could not contain its grief. But grief turned into song. Poet Prafulla Chandra Roy penned a ballad that swept through villages and cities alike:</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“একবার বিদায় দে মা ঘুরে আসি,</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">হাসি হাসি পরব ফাঁসি, দেখবে ভারতবাসী…”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">(“Bid me farewell once, Mother, I shall return.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Smiling, I will embrace the noose, and all of India shall witness it.”)</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">This song became more than music — it was Khudiram’s spirit turned into melody. Farmers sang it in fields, students hummed it in classNamerooms, and mothers wept as they rocked their children to sleep with its lines. It became a hymn of sacrifice, a war cry of youth, a mother’s eternal farewell.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4 font-[600]">The Legend Lives On</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Khudiram Bose did not live to see 19, yet his death lit a torch for millions. His courage made others rise, his sacrifice strengthened the Swadeshi movement, and his smile at the noose became the face of youthful rebellion.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">In Midnapore, people still say: He was not just a boy. He was a spark that became a flame.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">A flame that burned in 1908, and still burns in the heart of a free India.</p>
