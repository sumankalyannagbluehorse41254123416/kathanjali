                                forward to. I eat, I sleep, I sit, I irritate people. That’s what a purposeless life does to a
                                man—it sharpens his bitterness and dulls everything else.

                                So I walked out—no plan, no destination. Just a whisper inside that said, “Enough.”

                                The lake isn’t far. It’s the greenest part of our old town—one of the few places untouched by
                                noise and glass. Saritha and I used to visit often. Especially on Sundays, when she was still
                                strong. Before the chemo. Before everything became about tubes and tablets and slow heartbreak.
                                She loved that lake. Said it reminded her of God’s patience.

                                her laughter. On the far side, a couple sat close, the girl resting her head on the boy’s
                                shoulder. Near the cricket pitch, a young father was showing his son how to hold a bat. Another
                                elderly couple sat holding hands across the water—still together.
