                        Long ago, in a small village, famine had turned the earth into cracked clay and the air into
                        dust. Wells lay dry, and the sound of cooking had vanished from homes.
                    </p>

                        In a humble hut lived an old Brahmin, his wife, their son, and daughter-in-law. For days, they
                        had eaten nothing. At last, the Brahmin returned one evening with a handful of barley flour—the
                        only grain he could find after hours of searching. His wife ground it, shaped it into four small
                        rotis, one for each of them. The aroma was faint but heavenly to their empty stomachs.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        Just as they were about to eat, a knock came at the door.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        Outside stood a frail, dusty traveller. His eyes pleaded before his lips moved: “I am hungry. I
                        have not eaten in days. Please give me something to eat.”
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        The Brahmin bowed and said, <i>“Atithi Devo Bhava”</i> — the guest is like God. He placed his
                        own roti
                        into the traveller’s hands. The man ate quickly but still looked hungry.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        Without hesitation, the wife brought her share. Her husband was reluctant, but she said: <i>“I
                            could never eat while my husband was starving—and before our guest was full.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        The traveller ate again, but his hunger did not fade.

                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        Then the son stepped forward. “It is the duty of a son to fulfill the wishes of his parents,” he
                        said, and gladly gave away his portion. Still, the guest’s hunger remained.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        At last, the daughter-in-law, her eyes gentle yet firm, offered her piece - <i>“I have always eaten after serving my elders. Today shall be no different.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        With all four rotis gone, the guest’s face softened. He blessed them and walked away into the fading light. The family, though starving, felt a deep joy—they had upheld the highest duty of hospitality, even at the cost of their lives.

                        In the corner of that hut, a mongoose had been watching. It was astonished at such sacrifice. That night, as everyone went to bed with empty stomachs, the mongoose searched for crumbs in the hall. As it rolled over the few grains of barley that had fallen, half of its body turned golden, shining like the sun.

                        The mongoose realized it had witnessed the greatest sacrifice ever made. Yet only half its body had changed. It roamed the world for years afterward, hoping to find another act as pure, so the rest of its body would turn golden.

                        Many years later, after the great Kurukshetra war, Yudhishthira was crowned King of Hastinapur. Though victorious, he carried the heavy burden of sin—for he had fought and slain his own kin. Seeking to cleanse himself and to bring prosperity to his subjects, he resolved to perform the Ashwamedha Yagna.

                        The sacrifice was conducted on a scale the world had never seen. Kings, sages, and nobles from distant lands arrived. Mountains of grain, rivers of ghee, heaps of gold—nothing was spared. Thousands were fed and gifted. The yajna became renowned as the grandest of ages.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        The mongoose heard of this. “Surely this will match the sacrifice of that poor Brahmin family,” it thought. It came to the yajna, rolled in the sacred ground… but nothing changed.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">
                        It stood before Yudhishthira and declared: “O King, your yagna is vast, but it does not equal the sacrifice of a poor Brahmin family during a famine. They gave not from abundance, but from emptiness. They gave their very life’s food—knowing they would go hungry, perhaps die. That is the measure of true sacrifice. That is the essence of yagna.”

                        Yudhishthira was humbled. The assembled sages fell silent.
