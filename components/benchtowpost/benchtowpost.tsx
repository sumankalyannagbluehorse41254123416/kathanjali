                                up.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Just as I was about to take the first bite,
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I saw him watching me.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Hungry eyes.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“I’m hungry. Are you?” I asked.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">He looked at me for a moment and nodded.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">So I gave him half my chapati roll.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Then I opened my bottle.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“Have some, Uncle,” I said.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">He took a sip… and then he smiled.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I started talking.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I told him about my friend who cried in
                                className because he lost his pencil.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">About how Mummy makes the best bhaji in the
                                world.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">And how one time, I gave half my lunch to a
                                puppy, and it followed me till the gate.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">He didn’t talk much.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">But then, suddenly - he laughed.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">A small one.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Like something inside him had woken up
                                after a long nap.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I liked that laugh.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">So I told him more stories.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">And he kept smiling.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">When we finished eating, I packed my
                                tiffin.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“I have to go now, or Mummy will be angry,”
                                I said.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I walked about ten steps.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Then I felt something and turned back.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">And I saw it</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">The brightest smile I’ve ever seen.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Like he wasn’t just smiling with his mouth,
                                but with his whole face.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Like a drawing where the sun has a face,
                                and it’s smiling too.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">It made me feel… warm.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I ran back.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I hugged him. Tight.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Like I hug Papa when I get a special gift.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">He didn’t speak.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">But he hugged me back.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">His arms felt gentle.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">A little shaky.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I think he had tears in his eyes.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Then I ran home, before Mummy shouted
                                again.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">⸻</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">When I got back, she scolded me like
                                always.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“You’re late again, Ani!”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I didn’t answer.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I was still smiling.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Lost in the park.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">She stared at me, still holding my arms.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Then she asked softly,</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“What happened? Did you find something?”
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">I nodded.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“Yes. I met Krishna today.”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">She blinked.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“Where?”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“He was much older than I thought,” I said.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“And he had the best smile in the world.”
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">⸻</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">In another part of town, the old man was
                                walking home.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Light on his feet.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Maybe even humming.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">When he reached, he rang the bell.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">His son opened the door, surprised.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“Appa, where were you? You look… good.”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">John didn’t answer right away.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">He just nodded and sat down.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">As his son poured him a cup of coffee,</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">John finally said,</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“I feel better today.”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">He smiled.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Then, after a long pause, added softly:</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“I met God today…”</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">Another pause.</p>
                            <p className="text-base text-gray-900 leading-relaxed  mb-4">“…He was much younger than I expected.”</p>
